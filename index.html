  <h1>Happy Birthday, You Glorious Disaster 🫶🏻 </h1>

  <div>
    <p>Congrats - you’ve somehow survived another lap around the sun without getting arrested or abducted. That’s honestly kinda impressive.</p>
<p>Birthdays: nature’s subtle way of saying “eat more cake and pretend your life isn’t a hot mess.”</p>
<p>Cheers to you — definitely older, questionably wiser, but undeniably louder.</p>
<p>You’re aging like fine wine… just kidding, more like expired milk. Still loveable though. Mostly.</p>
<p>I was gonna get you a gift, but then I remembered... you already have me. So you’re welcome.</p>
<p>They say age is just a number. Yours is just, u’know... starting to get a little *up there*.</p>
<p>Hope your day’s full of cake, chaos, and at least a few poor decisions you'll pretend were totally worth it.</p>
<p>Live it up — soon you won't need a permission slip to party past 9PM. 👽</p>
